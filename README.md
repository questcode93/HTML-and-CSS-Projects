# HTML and CSS Projects #
This is the main repository for my HTML and CSS projects. The projects themselves were completed for a course on the implementation of polyglot XHTML5 and CSS3. No frameworks or templates were used to compose the webpages.

## Objectives ##
The primary objective of the course and projects was to create syntactically correct, polyglot XHTML and CSS3 webpages. The emphasis of the course was to learn the correct syntax (i.e. closing all tags, etc.) so that students would not only learn XHTML, but also, by extension, the XML standard as proposed by the W3C.

In addition, for the final project we were tasked with creating the following supporting documents:

* Hierarchial website map
* 2-D wireframe diagrams
* Webpage storyboards
* Deconstruction and analysis of similar websites
* UX and accesibility evaluation

## Software Used for Creation
Basic text editors were used for the creation of the XHTML and CSS text files. However, all code was tested against a code validator set to the polyglot XHTML standard. This provided recommendations for accesiblity improvements and warnings / errors for syntactically incorrect code.
